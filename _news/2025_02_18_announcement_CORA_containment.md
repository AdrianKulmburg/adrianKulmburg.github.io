It is official, a giant chunk of the coding I did during my PhD is now available in <a href="https://github.com/TUMcps/CORA">the CORA toolbox</a>, specifically, for version 2025.1.0! </br>
The new update contains novel techniques to check for containment of two sets, and also gives a way to measure 'how far away' a set is from being contained. Moreover, the new release of AROC is also on the way, which will allow using those new CORA techniques in practice.
