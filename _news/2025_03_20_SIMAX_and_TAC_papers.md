A few days ago, I uploaded new versions of my two papers that I submitted to the SIAM journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications (SIMAX) and the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (TAC). I am very excited, since the reviews for both papers have been quite positive!

The two papers can be found here:
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00605">SIMAX-paper</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00605">TAC-paper</a>

Of course, many thanks to the anonymous reviewers, for there very insightful comments and suggestions!
