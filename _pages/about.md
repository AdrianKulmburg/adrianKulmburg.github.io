My research focuses on answering questions that arise in topics such as discrete geometry or differential equations, using methods from functional analysis and complexity theory, with applications to the trajectory planning of cyber-physical systems.

I am currently employed at the Cyber-Physical Systems Group led by [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Matthias Althoff](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/cps/members/prof-dr-ing-matthias-althoff/), at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). However, I am a mathematician at heart and received my Master's degree in Mathematics from the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) of Zurich, where I also wrote my Master's thesis under the supervision of [Prof. (em.) Dr. Michael Struwe](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~struwe/). I also hold two Bachelor's degrees from ETH Zürich, one in mathematics and one in physics.
