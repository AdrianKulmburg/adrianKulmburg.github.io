My research focuses on formal methods for hybrid cyber-physical systems, for example for the safe trajectory planning of autonomous vehicles or robots.

I am currently employed at the [group of Logic of Autonomous Dynamical Systems](https://logic.kastel.kit.edu/team/) led by [Prof. Dr. André Platzer](https://symbolaris.com/), at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
Previously, I was employed at the Cyber-Physical Systems Group led by [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Matthias Althoff](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/cps/members/prof-dr-ing-matthias-althoff/), at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), and received my Master's degree in Mathematics from the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) of Zurich, where I also wrote my Master's thesis under the supervision of [Prof. (em.) Dr. Michael Struwe](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~struwe/). I also hold two Bachelor's degrees from ETH Zürich, one in mathematics and one in physics.
