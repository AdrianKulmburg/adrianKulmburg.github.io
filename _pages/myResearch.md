My current research focuses on using methods from functional analysis, such as tensor products of Banach spaces, to containment problems (i.e., checking whether a set is contained within another one). Both are connected via their applications to matrix norms.
I also work on geometric problems for set-based reachability analysis, which can roughly be described as the guaranteed solution of ODE systems with initial sets (instead of initial points).
