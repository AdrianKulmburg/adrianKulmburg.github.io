My current research focuses on safety guarantees of cyber-physical systems, such as autonomous vehicles or robots. I am currently developing methods to formalize the consistency of complex systems, with the help of differential dynamic logic for hybrid systems.

Though seemingly unrelated, my research also ecompasses methods from functional analysis, such as tensor products of Banach spaces, as these concepts are connected to the computation of matrix norms, which in turn can be used to verify whether certain kinds of sets are contained in a given area (for instance, if both regions are modeled using ellipsotopes).
