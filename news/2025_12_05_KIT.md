I am thrilled to announce that I will start working as a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.kit.edu/">Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)</a>, where I will be working with <a href="https://symbolaris.com/index.html">Prof. Dr. André Platzer</a> at the <a href="https://logic.kastel.kit.edu/">Logic of Autonomous Dynamical Systems group</a>, beginning in January 2026.

It will be a very interesting experience for sure, not just because the research topics are very interesting, but because I plan to be as prolific as possible, especially in the first few months of 2026, due to some strict deadlines. Can't wait!
